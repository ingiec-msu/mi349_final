            <li class="captext"><blockquote>Today I visited the Kiki’s Delivery Service Café, and it honestly felt like stepping right into the movie. The moment I walked in, everything was soft, cozy, and a little magical—like Kiki herself might walk by with Jiji at any moment. The decorations were adorable: broomsticks on the walls, little bakery-style displays, and even tiny references hidden around the café for fans to spot.

The food and drinks were just as cute. I ordered a themed dessert that was almost too pretty to eat, and a latte with Kiki art on top that made me smile the second it arrived. The whole place had this warm, nostalgic vibe that made it really easy to relax and just enjoy the moment.

I took so many photos; of the decorations, the food, the little corners of the café that looked straight out of a Studio Ghibli scene. There were other fans there too, and everyone had the same excited, soft energy you get when you’re around something you truly love.

Visiting the Kiki’s Delivery Service Café was such a wholesome experience. It felt like a quiet escape from the city, tucked inside a world of magic and childhood memories. I’d definitely go again, maybe on a rainy day, just to soak in the cozy Ghibli atmosphere all over again.</blockquote></li>

            <li class="username subtitle">Celebrating My Birthday in Korea</li>
            <li class="captext"><blockquote>This year, I got to celebrate my birthday in Korea, and it honestly feels like one of those memories I’ll hold onto forever. I started the day by picking out two adorable cakes; a white bunny cake and a purple Kuromi cake. They were almost too cute to eat, the kind of cakes you stare at for five minutes before finally cutting into them.

In the evening, my friends and I went to a cozy restaurant near our campus at Yonsei. It felt really special celebrating somewhere that’s become part of my everyday life here. The food was warm, the atmosphere was relaxed, and my friends made me laugh the entire time. It was simple, but in the best way; just good people, good food, and that soft birthday excitement you can’t recreate.

After dinner, we brought out the cakes, took way too many photos, and ate until we were all too full. I remember feeling so grateful in that moment; not just for the celebration, but for the people who made Korea feel like home.

Celebrating my birthday in Korea didn’t feel extravagant or over the top, but it felt right. Sweet, cozy, and full of little moments I’ll always remember.</blockquote></li>

            <li class="username subtitle">Christmas-Themed Cafes in Korea</li>
            <li class="captext"><blockquote>Today my friend and I visited a Christmas-themed café in Korea, and it instantly pulled us into holiday mode. The moment we walked in, everything felt festive—twinkling lights, soft Christmas music, and decorations in every corner. It honestly felt like stepping into a warm little winter escape right in the middle of the city.

We shared a brownie topped with a big scoop of ice cream, and it was so good. Warm, gooey, and perfect with the cold ice cream melting on top. I also tried an affogato matcha coffee, which sounds intense but somehow tasted like a cozy mix of bitterness and sweetness. It was the perfect drink for a cold December day.

We spent time chatting, taking pictures of the cute decorations, and just enjoying the calm holiday atmosphere. There’s something about Korean themed cafés; they really know how to make you forget the outside world for a little while.

Visiting a Christmas café here definitely made the season feel extra magical. I’m already tempted to try a few more before the holiday ends.</blockquote></li>
