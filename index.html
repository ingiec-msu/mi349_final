            <li class="captext"><blockquote>Walking onto the Yonsei University campus for the first time felt like stepping into a movie. The early morning air was chilly, the trees lining the paths were still waking up to winter, and the blue “YONSEI” banners waving on the lamp posts made everything feel surreal. I had seen pictures of the campus before, but being there in person—hearing students laughing, the rumble of buses, the little bursts of Korean conversations around me—felt completely different. My first stop was the iconic Underwood Hall. I swear every study-abroad vlog I’ve ever watched filmed at that exact spot. Standing in front of it made me weirdly emotional, like I had finally arrived at a place I’d been imagining for so long. After taking a few pictures (okay… a lot of pictures), I followed the uphill path toward my classroom building. Yonsei has so many slopes—no one warned me about the mini workout you get just walking from building to building. Inside the classroom, I immediately felt the mix of nerves and excitement buzzing through everyone. Students from all over the world were introducing themselves, sharing what languages they spoke and where they were from. The professor’s warm welcome made it feel even more real: "You are now part of the Yonsei community." At lunch, a few of us wandered down toward Sinchon. The streets were full of cafés, restaurants, and little stationery shops that just pulled you in. We ended up getting hotteok from a street vendor, and that first bite—warm, sugary, and crispy—felt like the perfect “welcome to Korea” moment. By the time I headed back to my dorm, my feet hurt, my backpack felt heavier, and my brain was full… but in the best way. My first day at Yonsei wasn’t perfect, or glamorous, or calm—but it was the start of something I know I’ll remember for the rest of my life.</blockquote></li>

## **My First K-Pop Concert: NCT Nation 2023**

I still can’t believe I actually went to NCT Nation 2023. Even now, when I think about it, it feels like a dream. I remember walking toward the stadium with my lightstick in my hand, trying not to freak out. Everywhere I looked, there were fans wearing green, taking selfies, and talking excitedly. I kept thinking, *“Oh my god… I’m really here.”*

When I finally found my seat, I couldn’t sit still. My hands were shaking a little, and the music playing before the show even started was enough to make my heart jump. But the moment the lights went down? My soul left my body. The entire stadium screamed at the same time, and I screamed too without even realizing it.

Seeing NCT walk onto the stage for the first time… I don’t even know how to describe it. They looked unreal. Like, I’ve seen them through screens so many times, but seeing them right there—with the lights, the fireworks, the huge live vocals—was overwhelming in the best way. I think I forgot to breathe during the first three songs.

I loved every single performance. The way the bass vibrated through the floor, the fan chants shaking the air, the members smiling and joking during the talk segments… it felt like I was part of something bigger. I still remember shouting member names until my voice cracked. Totally worth it.

At one point, I just stopped recording and watched. I wanted to remember the moment without a screen blocking it. The ocean of green lightsticks, the heat from the fireworks, the sound of tens of thousands of people screaming the same lyrics—it felt like pure magic.

By the time the concert ended, I was sweaty, tired, and basically running on adrenaline. My phone battery was dying, my throat hurt, and my feet felt like they were going to fall off… but I was so ridiculously happy. Walking out of the stadium with everyone chanting “NCT! NCT!” made me smile like an idiot.

I think that night changed me a little. It was my first K-pop concert ever, and I don’t think I could have asked for a more perfect first experience. NCT Nation 2023 will always be one of those memories I come back to when I need something to make me smile.
